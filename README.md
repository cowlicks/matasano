# matasano
Solutions to the Matasano crypto challenges from [cryptopals.com](http://cryptopals.com/).

## project structure
The challenges are broken into seven sets, these correspond to directories in this project. Inside each directory are the challenges for that set. Some of the problems are implementations of functions which already exist in the standard library of the programing language used, but they are implemented anyway for practice (like the hex to base64 challenge for example).
